# Data Comparison Tool

## Project Overview
The **Data Comparison Tool** is a web-based application built using Streamlit that enables users to compare data across multiple sources effortlessly. Whether you're dealing with CSV files, databases, or APIs, this tool facilitates detailed analysis and reporting, making data validation straightforward and efficient.

## Installation

To run this application locally, you will need to install the required dependencies and run the Streamlit server.

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/data-comparison-tool.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd data-comparison-tool
   ```
3. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```
4. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
5. Launch the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## Usage

1. Upon running the application, you will see tools to load sample or custom datasets.
2. Select your source and target data types (CSV, API, SQL Server, etc.).
3. Upload your datasets or use built-in sample data for comparison.
4. Configure the column mappings to specify how the columns from both datasets correspond.
5. Click on the "Compare" button to see the results, which will provide metrics on how the datasets match.
6. You can download detailed reports after the comparison.

## Features
- Support for various data sources including CSV files, APIs, SQL databases, and more.
- Automatic mapping of columns between datasets.
- Summary statistics and detailed reports on matching rows and columns.
- User-friendly interface for uploading data and configuring comparisons.
- Downloadable reports in various formats.

## Dependencies

The project requires the following Python packages, listed in `requirements.txt`:
- `pandas` - for data manipulation and analysis.
- `streamlit` - for building the web application.
- Additional dependencies related to database connections and data handling might be included based on your specific implementation.
